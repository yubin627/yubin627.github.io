It has been almost 10 years after I graduated from university, so I think it's a good time to take a look-back and reflect what I have seen, experienced and accomplished.

## After Graduation

Fresh out of school I had problems finding the right job. Personally I think the global economic downturn played a big part back then, when the subprime mortgage crisis spread to Singapore and there were not many job openings in the market. As a result I landed on a job not related to my degree - it was a role in financial printing sector. On that job I was managing a bunch of clients and attended to their printing needs everyday, specifically on the legal document requirements. Though it was not a very technical role, I am happy that I got a side-view of the finance industry and learnt how to put myself in others' shoes and how to manage multiple projects in parallel without missing any deadlines or raising any conflicts. 

After a short stint there, I decided to move on and started looking for engineering jobs again as I was not satisfied with my personal growth in the 'hard' skillset. (By nature I am still a person who likes to learn, talk and build stuff instead of relaying information from one party to another.)

## Engineering

I then spent 6 years in semiconductor industry dealing with manufacturing process of microchips. I love my work there where I applied statistical analysis to troubleshoot / optimize the manufacturing process and equipments so as to maximize product yield and quality. The tools I used back then were more 'proprietary' and a bit different from the newest applications / libraries widely recognized these days; but the key concepts and frameworks are essentially built on the same thing. I used JMP as well as in-house software to design experiments and analyse results, used SQL to extract lots (a lot is a batch of <=25 wafers in the manufacturing line) history and also used Tableau to report results to leadership.

Day by day I realized that the part that I enjoyed the most (and also the core) of my job is turning data into a story that can be easily understood by my audience, be it the manufacturing team, the planning team or my best friends - engineering team. How to use the least words to tell a concise and effective story that drives actions is the skill that I'd like to continue practising in the rest of my professional life.

At the same time, I saw opportunities blooming in the data science field which was also the driving force of the prospering semiconductor market. Large computing power became indispensable to almost all companies (or even at individual level) to be able to catch up with the growing speed of others. Rather than producing the 'crops' to power up the intelligence of other companies / individuals, I found myself also inclined to step into that field - what can I do to unleash the power of data to make an impact to the organization?

I believe this is also definitely something that semiconductor industry is moving towards - smart manufacturing, if well designed and implemented at large scale, could win company great advantages in producing high quality products within shorter cycle time. However this job is easier said than done - particularly in semiconductor business. First among all the complex reasons is the IP issue of manufacturing process and equipments which involve multiple up/down-stream stakeholders; and no one plays a small role here. This has decreed that the data must be managed by a centralized group of authorized and highly skilled personnel; in consequence, data democritization and knowledge sharing is probably something that's never going to be rolled out to the wider engineering team. There is definitely entry barrier to learn data science skills on the job (but trained professionals are very welcomed I believe).

## Digital Advertising

I turned my eyes elsewhere - it's natural that internet company should be my next choice. Why? These companies are built upon the principles of openness and forward thinking so it matches with my goal of keeping updating my skillset in data science. Digital advertising, in particular, has caught my attention. I have read a bit on this and was amazed by the ecosystem and the mechanism of online ads buying/selling. It is really fascinating how fast this business is growing with ever-evolving technologies backing up every piece of it. I'm glad that I managed to land on an analytics role in a leading agency in this field, where I garnered skills in data ETL (extract, tranform and load) flow, experienced cloud computing on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and AWS (Amazon Web Services) and also got hands-on in writing Python and R scripts to answer measurement questions. I enjoyed this learning process very much, as I was able to pick up new tools to solve business problems that see results quickly. 

For example, I applied A/B testing in creative studies to explore various messaging approaches and was able to find that seasonal messaging would be much more effective in raising search interest than a general one. This saved efforts from clients in generating and spending on the less effective creatives. I also managed to prove statistically the value of the digital portion of a campaign by applying the [MarketingMatching](https://rdrr.io/cran/MarketMatching/man/MarketMatching.html) R package. This helped convince the clients in scaling up the digital spend in the future campaigns.

This way I've got to deal with data generated by humans and come up with insights about user behaviors that can later drive business decisions. I love this process.

There is only one reason for me to leave my last job - I want to turn data into products that can bring greater benefits to the organization.  To be 100% honest I don't think agency environment could provide much playground for practising  new technologies to solve problems critical to the core business - to give an example, we can't answer the basic question on how much we should split the spend among offline / online marketing channels, simply because we don't have the holistic perspective of the business and don't own the data. 


## Still on the way

So this year I gave myself a career break for enrichment academically, while also on the lookout for opportunities that can productize insights from data. 

At the beginning of this year I was closing off the courses that I signed up before (but never finished) with DataCamp, Udacity and edx. Those courses definitely gave me great tips in how to use the essential toolbox of a data scientist. I'd strongly recommend whoever interested taking up [DataCamp's SQL course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-sql), [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) and [coursera's Data Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-tableau/home/welcome) course as an introduction to analytics. Thereafter, I joined General Assembly's Data Science Immersive bootcamp to gain a structured understanding of the machine learning algorithms and to get familiarized with the deep learning frameworks. Now I have graduated from the course and the biggest three takeaways I had are: 1) formed a habit of learning something new everyday; 2) knew a good bunch of friends with whom I can exchange interesting topics; 3) got hands-on practice on a few projects applying newly learned skills including Regression Modeling, NLP, CNN etc.

This has come to an end of my reflection.
Learning never ends and I am still just scratching the surface. 
Let's KEEP THE GAME ON!
